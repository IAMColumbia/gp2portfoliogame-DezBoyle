Every island needs an area.  A bounding box.
Also a set of points to connect other island's set of points to.  Snapping them together LEGO style

When generating, make sure these safe areas dont collide.  If they do, undo and try other options (recursive)

Generation: 
Recipe: Braches - Amount of times to make a branch (a string of island-island makes a branch)
BranchLengthMin/Max

CreateBranch(Vec3 pos):
CreateBranch (Island connectedIsland = null): 
SpawnIslandRecursive(connectedisland or pos)
//break condition is the random(branchlengthmin , max)
//keep a command pattern of the islands that were spawned so they can be undone?
//or just delete the previous one if we get ubstructed (no way to spawn the amount of islands needed (random min max))

place the island in a the direction of (connected island - connected position) the vector away
then rotate it around the Y axis until the point has the lowest distance to the connected Island to get the rotation
then calculate the offset and place the island at the right position
